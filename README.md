# Flasher Smart Contracts

A collection of Ethereum smart contracts simulating Bitcoin-like transactions, including address masking, block headers, and mock blockchain flash transactions. These contracts are intended for testing, educational, and demonstration purposes. **Use at your own risk.** We do not take responsibility for any loss or issues that may arise from using this code in production environments.

## Key Features

- **Simulated Bitcoin Transactions**: Mimics Bitcoin-like transactions on Ethereum.
- **Address Masking**: Hide wallet addresses to enhance privacy in transactions.
- **Blockchain Block Simulation**: Simulate Bitcoin-like blocks, including headers and hashes.
- **Mock Flash Transactions**: Flash mock transactions that simulate Bitcoin transaction behaviors.
- **ERC20 Token**: Includes a mock Bitcoin token for testing and development.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Hardhat or Truffle framework (for smart contract deployment)
- MetaMask or Web3-compatible wallet

### Steps to Deploy

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-flasher/flasher-smart-contracts.git
    cd flasher-smart-contracts
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Compile the smart contracts:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

4. Deploy the contracts to the desired network (e.g., Rinkeby):

    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
    ```

### Example Contract Address (Rinkeby Testnet)

After deployment, use the generated contract address. Example:

0x5f57F09F14327Db42c79f013024dbd8D48cc9b98

## Education Warning

These smart contracts are for **testing and educational purposes only**. Running this code in a live environment is **risky**. Our team is not responsible for any issues or losses that occur from using this code improperly. 

Do **not** use this in production without a thorough understanding of how it works and without ensuring it is safe for use. Always test on a test network first, such as Rinkeby or another testnet.
